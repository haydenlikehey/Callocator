# Callocator

I got this bright idea out of the blue: What if I made C heap allocation an easier process? Well, I hadn't coded anything in a while so I thought "Why the hell not?" Turns out, allocating memory isn't actually the hard part. It's keeping track of pointers in a big ass project, right? Guess this is a little useless. But! I learned how to make and use unions, so it wasn't all for naught.

## Is this easier than just using malloc?

Honestly? Idk. Probably not. This is honestly a little stupid. I just haven't written code in a while and was struck with the idea. But it could be easier if you're just starting out! I have some ideas for expansions that might make it easier lol.
